# Frontend Developer Position
The task for applying for the frontend developer position @ RCCO. If you have found this without knowing anything about the position, check out the career post [here](https://rcco.uk/careers/front-end-developer).

## Introduction

At RCCO we work with Technology brands, ranging from startup to enterprise. This means that the developement work can range from either creating a completely new online presence for the company or editing/updating a specific part of their internal app. Our current goto development stack for development is; [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

In the task below, we have tried to capture the average hand off task that would be given during a project development sprint.

## Brief

One of the key parts in the world with the current state of the coronavirus has been the use of availabilty of statistical information. Our client has asked us to create a dashboard displaying the latest corona virus cases using the [GOV.UK API](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/developers-guide) for the United Kingdom.

The design team have already created the mockups for the dashboard which are below, therefore the the next steps are to translate the mockups to code. The stack the client has asked for only requires either Vue.js or Nuxt.js. The maximum timeframe for this task is two working days (bonus if submission is even shorter).

## Tasks
* Develop a base structure for the api results to be displayed using the mockups provided.
* Integrate a way to pull the data from the api into the site
* Host the website using your preferred way
* Store the project in a Github repo
